# Ultimate Dark Mode Skin for Steam
This is a pack that merges a few different dark mode skins for Steam, courtesy of [BallOpener's guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1941650801). It's a mix of:

- [Metro for Steam](https://metroforsteam.com/)
- [Unofficial Patch for Metro for Steam](https://github.com/redsigma/UPMetroSkin) with the [following options](https://prnt.sc/sbh8au)
- [Steam Dark Mode](https://github.com/AikoMidori/steam-dark-mode) for the web pages, but I made a few color changes to the Carousel Thumbs (dots below the displays on store, normal color's gray)
- [Steam Library Makeover](https://github.com/AikoMidori/steam-library)
- [Custom Friends UI](https://steamchatskinning.tk/#customisation) <br/>
